# Cinder Breakout

### What is this project?

I will be recreating the popular arcade & retro game `Breakout` using Cinder and C++. The game involves eliminiating a set of randomly spawned blocks by strategically bouncing a ball on a player-controlled movable plate. If the ball is not caught by the plate, the game ends/restarts.

# Why do I want to do this project? 

I used to play this game a lot growing up, and would love to implement it by myself. 

# A rough timeline of what will get accomplished and when 
The draft timeline is as follows:
- week 1: Build a functional prototype version of the game
- week 2: Add UI/UX enhancements, scoreboard, play/pause functionality
- week 3: Add multi-users support with leaderboard

# If I were to finish the project early, what extra "stretch goals" could I implement?

Some stretch goals I had in mind are:

- Create customizable block and ball colors (GUI enhancement)
- Implement sounds for ball bounces, game end/start etc. (UI enchancement)
- Hardcore mode, where player has to manage 2 balls and 2 plates (one plate above as well which mirrors the bottom plate) (Gameplay enchancement)
