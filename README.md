## Installing

You can (eventually) find an executable under the releases tab.

For now, clone the repository into your Cinder workflow, under _~/Cinder/my-projects/_
From there, you can use an IDE or command line to build an executable using the final-project-gui CMake target.

## Vision

See Proposal.md for a more in-depth explanation of what my goals for this project are.
